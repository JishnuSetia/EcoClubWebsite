                <br><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: left;">I would like to extend a warm welcome to our esteemed guests from the Office of the Crown Prince, His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Bin Faisal Al-Qassimi. Your presence here today reflects a shared vision for a greener, healthier future, and we are grateful for your support in our endeavours.<br><br>
                    HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Faisal Al Qassimi is a member of the Ruling family. He anchors various public and private ventures in UAE spanning across sectors like water, energy, Agriculture, mining, banking, infrastructure, education and hospitality.  He is a recipient of the Mother Teresa International Award for Culture and Administration.<br><br>
                    They have embarked on a green sustainability drive of planting 1 million plants in UAE in the year 2024 which enhances the commitment that this country had made towards the global community during the COP28.<br><br>
                    The importance of sustainability cannot be overstated. Our planet faces unprecedented challenges - climate change, pollution, and resource depletion - threatening our very existence, health, and future. Ignoring sustainability is akin to playing Russian roulette with our planet; temporary luck may prevail, but dire consequences loom. Thus, as individuals, communities, and nations, embracing sustainability becomes imperative.<br><br>
                    At GEMS Modern Academy, we embody this commitment through various initiatives like the aeroponics garden, the planter's patch, the revive project, project carter, recycling collection drives, Biofuel project and many more.<br><br>
                    Finally, this leads to the spread of awareness in the community and in the society.<br><br>
                    Conclusion: Just as these trees will take root and grow, so will our commitment to environmental stewardship. Each tree represents a pledge to nurture and protect our planet, ensuring that it thrives for centuries to come.<br><br>
                    In conclusion, let us embark on this journey of environmental responsibility with enthusiasm and determination. Together, we can create a legacy that transcends time, leaving a lasting impact on our school, our community, and the world at large.</h3>
